Ceph is an emerging open-source parallel distributed file and storage system. By design, Ceph leverages unreliable commodity storage and network hardware, and provides reliability and fault-tolerance via controlled object placement and data replication. This paper presents our file and block I/O performance and scalability evaluation of Ceph for scientific high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Our work makes two unique contributions. First, our evaluation is performed under a realistic setup for a large-scale capability HPC environment using a commercial high-end storage system. Second, our path of investigation, tuning efforts, and finding made direct contributions to Cephâ€™s development and improved code quality, scalability, and performance. These changes should benefit both Ceph and the HPC community at large.
